				<li>Look at the other person, keep the gaze soft but maintain a steady eye contact for 2 minute. You may feel this is unnatural or uncomfortable, and it’s perfectly normal.</li>
				<li>Examine the other person’s face, and silently wish him/her freedom from suffering. You may silently recite “may you be free from suffering” or use other language that express this sentiment the best for you. Do so for 5 minutes.</li>
				<li>Close your eyes. Check in with your body and pay attention to your feelings and physical sensations. Ideally you would feel warm and at peace. But whatever feelings you have, honor them as legitimate.</li>
				<li>Share how the exercise went with each other.</li>
