				<li> Introduce yourself to each other, for example, you can mention what motivated you to do this exercise.</li>
				<li> Share a request you said yes to out of fear of displeasing others but didn’t really want to go through with.</li>
				<li> Write down a diplomatic response without apologizing or compromising your interests; keep it clear and short. You can use one of these lines if you have a hard time coming up with it:
				“I’m not going to do that.”
				“I don’t have the bandwidth to do that right now.”
				“I have other plans for the time / resource you are requesting.”</li>
				<li>4. For person A: make person B’s feared request to him/her. For person B: respond with an emphatic “absolutely not!”, do not worry about sounding angry or rude, it’s important to internalize you can say that, while it may not be ideal, it’s not catastrophic either. Pay attention to your body sensations, and have kind thoughts towards yourself.</li>
				<li>5. For person A: make person B’s feared request to him/her again. For person B: respond with the diplomatic response in step 3; strive for a neutral, friendly but unapologetic tone. Again, pay attention to your body sensations, and have kind thoughts towards yourself.</li>
				<li>6. Switch roles and repeat steps 4 and 5.</li>
				<li>7. Praise each other on being assertive, e.g. “great job standing up for yourself!” Share other thoughts you have for the exercise.</li>
